# Jobseekers-Application

(Project Summary)

I have been asked by a recruitment agency to develop a web application which should enable job-seekers to enter their data and then create a CV from it in a PDF format. The jobseeker should also be allowed to view and edit their CV as well. However, the web application should also enable the agency staff to search for job seeker by entering the job title where they want to work in, entering the minimum education level of the jobseekers, entering the minimum number of GCSE passes, entering the specific educational qualification, entering professional qualification, entering specific skills and experience of the jobseekers.


(Quality Goals and Expectations)

For expecting very good quality software within job seekers web application project, I have followed the software quality Core functionality and Ancillary functionality.

* Core functionality mentions to the key functionalities of my job seeker application is designed to fulfil, without which the application is useless. so for example, the core functionality of job seeker web application is to allow the jobseekers create a CV, edit their CV, generate the CV into PDF and enabling the agency to search for job seekers using specific criteria such as skills, job title, education and experience. If the job seekers web application cannot do this, then it’s not useful, it does not matter how good it’s been designed. For the Functional flexibility, the web application must be usable in every type of job seekers industry. Keeping the functional flexibility in mind during the development of my project, the job seeker web application has fully functional flexibility. This is been done by expert reviews, peer reviews, positive testing and functional testing.

* Ancillary Functionality is an extra functionality within the core functionality. So even if the ancillary functionality is not available, the web application is still useful. An example of my project is HTML CV form converter in to PDF (this is ancillary functionality). So if the job seekers web application does not have the PDF converter ancillary functionality, the web application is still useful. The Subcategories of ancillary Functionality (Safety and Security, Usability, Fault tolerance, Feel good, Esteem and One-upmanship) are also been expected within the job seekers web application.

(The Quality goals of my project are:)

* Maintainable in a way that the functionality can be easily modified. This is been done by making sure that my code is readable and understandable by other programmers.

* Portability - will allow the web application to be moved from one to another platform. This is been done by using the standard constructs of the programming language.

* Flexibility – To call my application a good “Quality application”, then the job seekers web application must be flexible. The application must be flexible in a way that even if some of the values change.

* Efficiency – to minimize the consumption of the system resources and execution time, the efficiency guidelines portion of the coding guidelines should be used.

* Modularity – the web application is been build using the stand-alone module in a way that the functionality is not duplicated. for example when a module is changed, the changes should not impact other modules of the web applications.

* Reusability – The Job seeker web application code must be developed in way that it can also be reused again in other different applications.

* Readability – is the first obligatory for maintainability. The web application mush have a very clear proper formatting of the code. it should also allow recognition of the beginning and end of merged multiline statement.

* Testability – the web application code should be written in a way that each software unit in its own must be testable with its test data.
